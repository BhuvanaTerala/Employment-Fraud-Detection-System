# Employment-Fraud-Detection-System
## Introduction
Advancement in technology has made one's life extremely facile. With these developments 
in technology, along with the benefits there have been many threats arising too. One of them is the 
Fake Job Posting, which is done by the scammers to fraud people. These scammers try to display 
fake job postings through which they try to get the application fee, or the personal details of the 
person who is trying to apply for it. We have chosen the job_fake_postings dataset from kaggle 
website, which was originally taken from The University of the Aegean | Laboratory of 
Information & Communication Systems Security, and has pretty good information through which 
we can build a classifier or predict results.
## Data Description
dataset:
[Link to Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/josereimondez/fake-jobs-posting-detection?select=fake_job_postings.csv)

The dataset consists of 18k jobs and their description, out of which only 800 are fake jobs. 
The data includes meta-data about the occupations in addition to textual information. Using the 
dataset, classification algorithms that can identify fake job descriptions can be developed.
